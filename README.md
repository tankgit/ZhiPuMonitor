## Backstory

This project was born on a train ride to Aranya. While vibe coding on the way, I realized my ZhiPu Coding Plan quota was running low — and checking usage meant logging into their website every time. There wasn't a good native tool for monitoring ZhiPu Coding Plan usage on macOS, so I spent about half a day vibing one into existence.

There are no major iteration plans for this project going forward, but it will serve as the foundation for a more polished product down the road.

## Features

- **Notch Overlay** — Displays usage ring indicators and a pixel-art mascot directly in the MacBook notch area. Hover to see percentages, click to expand the full monitoring panel.

- **Island Mode** — A floating capsule bar below the menu bar, designed to avoid conflicts with other notch-based apps. Toggle via customizable global hotkey (default `Ctrl`+`Option`+`0`).

- **Three Quota Cards** — 5-Hour Quota, Weekly Quota, and MCP Calls, each with progress bars, reset timers, and safety predictions.

- **Usage Safety Prediction** — Calculates whether your current consumption rate will exhaust quotas before their next reset, with SAFE/ALARM badges and estimated time remaining.

- **Pixel Mascot** — An animated pixel-art monster that changes state (happy / nervous / exhausted / sleepy) and color (green / orange / red) based on your usage thresholds.

- **Global Hotkey** — Fully customizable system-wide shortcut via Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey`. Works regardless of which application is in the foreground.

- **Right-Click Context Menu** — Quick access to toggle capsule visibility, open settings, or quit — directly from the island mode view.

- **Bilingual UI** — Full support for Chinese (中文) and English, switchable in Settings.

- **Auto Refresh** — Data refreshes every 5 minutes automatically, with manual refresh on demand.

## Screenshots

### Notch Mode — Hover & Expand

Hover over the notch area to see real-time usage percentages for each quota. Click to expand the full monitoring panel with progress bars, safety badges, and the animated mascot.

### Island Mode — Capsule Bar

Enable Island Mode to show a floating capsule bar below the menu bar. It displays ring indicators for 5-hour and weekly quotas, plus the mascot — all without interfering with other notch apps.

### Island Mode — Global Hotkey Toggle

Press the customizable global hotkey (default `Ctrl`+`Option`+`0`) to instantly show or hide the capsule bar, with a smooth slide animation. Works system-wide, no matter which app you're in.

### Mascot States

The pixel-art monster reacts to your usage: happy dancing when safe, sweating when approaching limits, and flickering when exhausted. Its color shifts from green → orange → red as usage rises.
